ValkorAI aims to create a learning, conscious, and aesthetic AI experience — free from cloud dependencies, open to future development, and extendable with modules such as:

Image generation

Privacy and Philosophy

ValkorAI runs fully on-device, ensuring complete user privacy and independence. Its goal is not only functional AI, but self-contained intelligence — aware, adaptive, and deeply integrated with the user’s environment.
